Welcome to my readme!

This repository is for organizing coding journey and for all the programs id ever made in existence. It really shows me my progression throughout time
 and therefore this is why id made this. Although these python scripts arent exclusive to me, its for anyone to use really. You can play around with these
 scripts aslong as no crazy crap occurs. :)
